# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

External APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in their context, frequently consuming this data via a server.

This aim of this project is to finish a weather dashboard application that called the OpenWeather API and renders the data in the browser
